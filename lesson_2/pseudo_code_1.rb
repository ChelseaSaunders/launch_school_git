# Write a code that does the following:
# a method that returns the sum of two integers

# CASUAL

# 1. Ask for a number.
# 2. Get the number from user input and assign it a variable; convert variable 
# to integer. 
# 3. Ask for a second number.
# 4. Get the number from user input and assign it a variable; convert variable 
# to integer. 
# 5. Create a method with two arguments that adds one argument to the other.
# 6. Plug the two variables into the method.
# 7. Print the result of the methor applied to the variables.

# FORMAL:

# START

# Prompt user to enter an integer.
# GET integer and SET to num1 and use .to_i to convert input from string to 
# integer.

# Prompt user to enter a second integer.
# GET integer and SET to num2 and use .to_i to convert input from string to 
# integer.

# Create method which takes two arguments and adds them together and SET the 
# answer to answer variable.
# Print answer variable.
