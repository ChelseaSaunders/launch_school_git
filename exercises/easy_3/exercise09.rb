# Write another method that returns true if the string passed as an argument is
# a palindrome, false otherwise. This time, however, your method should be
# case-insensitive, and it should ignore all non-alphanumeric characters. If
# you wish, you may simplify things by calling the palindrome? method you wrote
# in the previous exercise.
